# JavaScript The Good Parts

## Recursion

Recursion is best applied when you need to call the same function repeatedly with different parameters from within a loop. While it can be used in many situations, it is most effective for solving problems involving iterative branching, such as fractal math, sorting, or traversing the nodes of complex or non-linear data structures.

## Scope

In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables.

**In JavaScript, scope is the set of variables, objects, and functions you have access to.**

All the variables defined in a block (a list of statements wrapped with curly braces) are not visible from outside of the block. And all variables defined anywhere within a function is visible everywhere within the function.
